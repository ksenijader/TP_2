# How to use

Launch the tp_2.py script in your terminal indicating access path to your fasta files. The program will create an output file indicating if a non nucleotide is present, 
as well as its position, sequence name and file name. Only files in fasta format are accepted (.fa, .faa, .fasta).

testsequence.fa file contains fasta file with "false" nucleotides to test the code.
